### Current Outreach

#### Blurred Realities Exhibit Workshop - MSU Museum
##### Folks Involved: Rachel Roca, Emily Bolger, Sona Chitchyan, Dawson Kinsman, Cassie Lem
We will be hosting a workshop as part of the MSU Museum's upcoming exhibition, Blurred Realities, in January 2026. Our workshop, tentatively titled _AI and the Art of Distinguishing Reality: Understanding the Power of Data Visualizations in a Digital World_, will give audience members the opportunity to explore the differentiation between fabrication and factual information, specifically in the context of GenerativeAI. We will present claims to visitors that highlight different data-centered aspects of the MSU community - some of which will be rooted in fact and others will be fabricated using GenAI. The workshop will also aim to provide actionable strategies to guide audience members through using evidence through data and visualizations to prove or disprove claims presented.
