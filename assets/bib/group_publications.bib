	abstract = {High school science classrooms across the United States are answering calls to make computation a part of science learning. The problem is that there is little known about the barriers to learning that computation might bring to a science classroom or about how to help students overcome these challenges. This case study explores these challenges from the perspectives of students in a high school physics classroom with a newly revamped, computation-integrated curriculum. Focusing mainly on interviews to center the perspectives of students, we found that computation is a double-edged sword: It can make science learning more authentic for students who are familiar with it, but it can also generate frustration and an aversion towards physics for students who are not.},

	abstract = {Computation is becoming an increasingly important part of physics education. However, there are currently few theories of learning that can be used to help explain and predict the unique challenges and affordances associated with computation in physics. In this study, we adapt the existing theory of computational literacy, which posits that computational learning can be divided into material, cognitive, and social aspects, to the context of undergraduate physics. Based on an exploratory study of undergraduate physics computational literacy, using a newly developed teaching tool known as a computational essay, we have identified a variety of student practices, knowledge, and beliefs across these three aspects of computational literacy. We illustrate these categories with data collected from students who engaged in an initial implementation of computational essays in a 3rd-semester electricity and magnetism class. We conclude by arguing that this framework can be used to theoretically diagnose student difficulties with computation, distinguish educational approaches that focus on material vs cognitive aspects of computational literacy, and highlight the benefits and limitations of open-ended projects like computational essays to student learning.},

In this paper, we apply one of these CT frameworks and compare the results with a task analysis to examine how CT practices relate to specific design features of an in-class problem. We have analyzed video data from two separate groups working on one computational class period, which utilizes a minimally working program to model magnetic field vectors. While still in the initial stages of the study, our preliminary results indicate that what is left out of the minimally working program will impact the CT practices students use, particularly around building computational models. Ultimately, we hope this work will help instructors to design activities that can target \& build specific CT practices.},

We administered a pilot questionnaire in classrooms with computation integrated into their physics curricula and conducted a thematic analysis on student responses. Several expected themes (identified previously from teacher interviews) and emergent themes (emerging from open-ended responses to the survey) arose in our analysis. This work focuses on three main themes: the applicability of physics ideas in coding, computational thinking practices, and the usefulness of computation. We provide an in-depth discussion of response variation and its impact on future survey development.

The results suggest that more faculty have some form of computational teaching experience than a decade ago, but it appears that this experience does not necessarily translate to computational instruction in undergraduate students’ formal course work. Further, we find that formal programs in computational physics are absent from most departments. A majority of faculty do report using computation on homework and in projects, but few report using computation with interactive engagement methods in the classroom or on exams. Specific factors that underlie these results are the subject of future work, but we do find that there is a variation on the reported experience with computation and the highest degree that students can earn at the surveyed institutions.},

Near the end of their first year in the series, N=7 instructors were interviewed to explore their intended learning outcomes, design process, and implementation of computational activities. We conducted a thematic analysis on qualitative interview data to identify major themes from the teacher perspective. Herein, learning outcomes are articulated to investigate the professional development series effectiveness at helping teachers prepare activities aligned with science standards and their specific aims. Our analysis provides insight regarding the lack of specificity in learning outcomes, the absence of assessment on computational content, and difficulty navigating the space of crosscutting concepts around computation. This research informs the augmentation of computational physics professional development workshops, communicates recommendations for practitioners, and documents teachers intended learning outcomes when integrating computation in K-12 education spaces.},

	abstract = {Software development is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in STEM disciplines resulting in the need for education in associated computational skills. To address this need, we designed a "Sustainable Software Development with Collaborative Version Control" workshop in the 2019 Institute for Scientist \&amp; Engineer Educators (ISEE) Professional Development Program (PDP). We describe here the development process and following delivery of the workshop. In particular, we explored how to apply an inquiry approach to learning computational skills. By design, PDP activities intertwine content and “cognitive STEM practices,” and teasing apart content and practice is important for STEM education. We encountered challenges with this task because our content — exploring software sustainability with collaborative version control — is much like a practice in itself. We designed our workshop to introduce the critical skill of sustainable software development using collaborative version control systems with an inquiry approach rather than the more typically used, strictly technical approach. We emphasize the authentic, broadly applicable nature of the workshop in which learners jointly design, test, and discuss their own increasingly complex development workflows. The development process for our workshop may be useful for educators who want to introduce software practices to learners from many disparate STEM disciplines that leverage computational methods and require software development to approach research questions.},

	abstract = {Energy is a disciplinary core idea and a cross-cutting concept in the K-12 Framework for Science Education and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). As numerous authors point out, the energy model in these standards emphasizes the connections between energy and systems. Using energy ideas to interpret or make sense of phenomena means tracking transfers of energy across systems (including objects and fields) as phenomena unfold. To support students in progressing towards this goal, numerous representations—both static and dynamic—that describe the flow of energy across systems exist. Static representations work well to describe phenomena where the flow of energy is unidirectional and the dynamics are not a focus but struggle to represent circular energy flows and the temporal order of complex, dynamic phenomena. Existing dynamic representations like Energy Theater are usually qualitative, i.e., they represent energy in ways that differentiate between larger or smaller rates of transfer but do not provide a more detailed quantitative picture. In this article, we present how an existing, empirically tested, static representation called Energy Transfer Model (ETM) can be turned into a dynamic representation that is quantitatively accurate using the freely available 3D animation programming environment GlowScript ( https://www.glowscript.org ). To do so, we first summarize the central ideas in a model of energy that emphasizes the idea of energy transfer between systems, and we describe how the ETM represents those ideas. Then, we introduce the dynamic ETM and explain how it goes beyond the limitations of its static counterpart and how its quantitative accuracy adds to existing dynamic representations. Lastly, we discuss how the dynamic ETM can be used to integrate computational thinking into the physics classroom.},

	abstract = {The admission of graduate students to post-bachelor's physics programs is a complex and challenging system. Any graduate director, faculty member, or graduate student can recount their own vivid experience with that complicated and, quite often, opaque process.3 At Michigan State University, we set out to understand the admissions process, determine how it was functioning, and make changes to it. We hoped to admit more diverse candidates to our program, evaluate them more equitably and holistically, and, ultimately, create a more inclusive program where each student is valued and supported in their studies. We are far from our ideal collective vision but feel that our progress toward that vision is nonetheless important to share with our colleagues.},
